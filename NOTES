Board needs to know
- adjacent bombs count

Cell needs to know
- uncovered?
- flagged?
- bomb?

It may not make sense for the cell to only have knowledge of things it absolutely most know about: uncovered? flagged? bomb? the higher game pretty much needs to know about these anyway, but maybe just shove everything in the cell object for simplicity
